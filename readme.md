# PdDroidParty_some_examples
______________________________


This repo contains examples for the PdDroidParty framework : http://droidparty.net/
PdDroidparty enables you to run your Pure-Data patches on android, right away. It adds up a lot of wonderfull features such as replicating your sliders, enabling to theme and customize your patch with glorious svgs, deal with multi-touch, multi-window , accelerometer, networking etc.

This is not an introduction to Pure-Data, so this shouldn't be your first tutorials, but it still aims at beginners, it starts easy and finishes with some advanced stuff. It builds on previous work made on 2012, if I find time I'll update this with new examples of the latest features.

Check out the readme in each folder. (for now comments in patchs are in french only, this should change soon).

The first three tutorials are basic, they cover basic things in pd and give a few ressources to build on, after that we will look at more advanced stuff, and we will learn how to theme our programms with svg to make them look super-nice !
