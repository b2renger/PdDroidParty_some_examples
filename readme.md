# PdDroidParty_some_examples
______________________________


This repo contains examples for the PdDroidParty framework : http://droidparty.net/
PdDroidparty enables you to run your Pure-Data patches on android, right away. It adds up a lot of wonderfull features such as replicating your sliders, enabling to theme and customize your patch with glorious svgs, deal with multi-touch, multi-window , accelerometer, networking etc.

This is not an introduction to Pure-Data, so this shouldn't be your first tutorials, but it still aims at beginners, it starts easy and finishes with some advanced stuff. It builds on previous work made on 2012, if I find time I'll update this with new examples of the latest features.

Check out the readme in each folder.
